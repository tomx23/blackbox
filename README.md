# Demo Login (Can be found and edited in db.js)
-Username: user1

-Password: pass123

# Folders & Files
-The JS_Version folder was created accidentally. You can ignore it. It has the same files as the assets folder.

-db.js contains all the data that is stored. It acts like the "backend database" of the application.

-I've used multiple JS and CSS libraries to make the app look more attractive. All of them can be found in the assets/bower_components and assets/plugins folder

-The default.css file in the assets/css folder is a standardized css helper library I use throughout all my projects. It has descriptive class names that I can apply anywhere in the project rather than making custom class/styles for them.

# PHP Version
I couldn't upload the PHP version of the application since I couldn't find a platform that would let me upload the files including the database and run it. The JS version has most of the functionalities I intended, so it should be good.
